# Vanilla JS Micro-Frontend Example

This project demonstrates how to use the nxg-sports micro-frontends in a Vanilla JavaScript application.

## Purpose

Integrates the sportsbook micro-frontend using plain JavaScript, showing how to consume shared code from `packages/shared`.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies from the monorepo root:
   ```sh
   pnpm install
   ```
2. Open `index.html` directly in your browser, or use a static server:
   ```sh
   pnpm serve
   ```

## More Info

See the main [README.md](../../README.md) for details on integration and usage across frameworks.
